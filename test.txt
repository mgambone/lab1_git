What is version control, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records 
changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions 
later. Even though the examples in this book show software source code as the files under 
version control, in reality any type of file on a computer can be placed under version 
control.

If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you certainly would), it is very wise to use a Version Control System (VCS). A VCS allows you to: revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, review changes made over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can generally recover easily. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.Sat Aug 31 17:46:42 CDT 2013
